# MyAlarm - A Customizable Alarm App ‚è∞

## Introduction

I'm fed up with using alarm apps that never let me **fully customize the experience**. As a Robotics Software Engineer ü§ñ, I'm used to dealing with complex systems and automation, but when it came to Android app development, I had no clue where to begin. So I decided to create my own alarm app that I can tailor exactly to my needs!

## Why I Started This Project

- **Lack of Personalization:** Existing alarm apps offer basic features with little to no customization options.
- **Complete Control:** I wanted an app where I could control the look, sound, and behavior of the alarm.
- **Learning Journey:** Despite my experience in robotics, I was completely new to Android development. This project has been a great opportunity to learn something entirely new!

## First Steps üöÄ

1. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   - I configured my development environment using **VSCode**‚Äîmy go-to editor.
   - I created a custom **script** to compile the code and launch it on an Android emulator, which I had to set up from scratch.

2. **Understanding Android:**
   - I had to learn about the Android project structure: **Activities**, **Layouts**, **AndroidManifest.xml**, and resource files.
   - I rebuilt the project from scratch a couple of times to fully grasp how everything fits together.

3. **Building a Simple App:**
   - I finally managed to build a basic app that displays a button and a counter.
   - Each time the button is pressed, the counter increases by one‚Äîa simple yet satisfying first milestone!

## Project Structure

The repository is organized so that anyone can download, compile, and modify the project in Android Studio. Here's a typical structure:

## Repository Guidelines

To ensure the project remains clean and easy for others to work with:

- **Included Files:**  
  - All source code, configuration files (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `AndroidManifest.xml`), and resources (layouts, images, etc.).
  - A detailed README to guide you through compiling and running the app.
  
- **Ignored Files:**  
  - Local configuration files like `local.properties`.
  - Build directories such as `/build`.
  - IDE-specific folders (e.g., `.idea/` and `.vscode/`).

## What I've Achieved So Far

I've come a long way‚Äîfrom having no idea how to create an Android app to building a simple yet fully functional alarm app with a button and a counter. This journey has taught me a lot about Android development, and I'm excited to add more features and polish the experience even further!
